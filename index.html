<p>A rolling release OS excelling in virtual environments.</p>
<h2>

<p>SharkLinux maintains it’s own file system and ensures all
software is always up-to-date. In frequent communication with
SharkLinux servers, your installation is notified when updates have been made available and will automatically apply needed upgrades. You can rest assured any new features, bug fixes or updates will be handled by the OS. This is just one less thing to remember while you focus on what matters to you.</p>

<a id="rolling-release-constant-evolution" class="anchor" href="#rolling-release-constant-evolution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rolling Release; Constant Evolution</h2>

<p>Don't get bored with your OS! If you tried SharkLinux a month ago you may not recognize it today. That's because SharkLinux is under heavy and continuous development with new features and improvements being added all the time. Due to rapid evolution of SharkLinux, the official installation ISO is built fresh each week to ensure a new installation is ready to go without need for a ton of updates</p>

<h2>
<a id="shark-or-chameleon" class="anchor" href="#shark-or-chameleon" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shark or Chameleon?</h2>

<p> Discover the exceptional functionality SharkLinux keeps hidden  below the surface. With over 150 unique commands and growing by the day, SharkLinux offers countless features underneath the hood.  Whether you're a casual user looking for a top level desktop experience or a developer looking to make the next great application, SharkLinux has you covered. Built on Xenial LTS, SharkLinux has the most supported foundation available within a Linux environment and is guaranteed to see support/updates until 2021.</p>

<a id="virtualization-swiss-army-knife" class="anchor" href="#virtualization-swiss-army-knife" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtualization swiss army knife.</h2>

<p>SharkLinux loves virtual environments. It comes with KVM for Linux based VM's, QEMU for foreign platforms plus Docker Engine and LXC/LXD containers for a lighter option. We didn't forget the Linux cornerstone Libvirt, rather built on it by teaming it with Vagrant. Not enough options? No problem! If you have a specific idea in mind you can even design your own VM from scratch with vmdebootstrap. It’s all here; from  a minimal docker image to multi VM platforms and everything in between -  Spawn a container, Launch a cloud image or build a custom environment tailored to your needs.</p>

<a id="desktop-software minimalistic and simple interface but is packed with co-out-of-the-box" class="anchor" href="#desktop-software-out-of-the-box" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Desktop software out of the box.</h2>

<p>SharkLinux encourages everyone to customize their system to their needs, but who wants to spend hours setting up? Included in the system are hand picked software packages to cover almost any need. Gimp helps you master your photo editing, Libre office suite provides word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and more. Media junkie? VLC and Audacious make sure you have access to top tier video and audio. </p>

<p>Sometimes containers or VM's just won't do. A shark wasn't meant to live in a box and neither will SharkLinux. SL comes equipped with "Alien"; a tool to convert packages from other linux variants to our native .deb format,  meaning that rpm package can be used directly on your system. Mac builds on Homebrew have you keeping that apple around? Not anymore. Ported for linux, Linuxbrew lets you keep brewing without switching your OS. Of course Windows can't be forgotten. The most recent WINE build is available to run those .exe files that you can't do without. Compatability; it's kind of a big deal </p>

<a id="real-sharks-swim-upstream" class="anchor" href="#real-sharks-swim-upstream" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Real Sharks swim upstream.</h2>
<p>The SharkLinux graphical environent is built on upstream MATE
desktop. Our repository mirrors the PPA of the MATE development team so you'll enjoy using version 1.16 instead of the default 1.14 like our friends using Ubuntu.. To ensure you never get left in shallow waters you'll also get updates with development releases of the Linux kernel and other key elements of the base Xenial filesystem.  Not afraid to live on the edge? You can switch your installation to the “Edge” release, featuring MATE 1.18, HWE Kernel series 4.10.* and experimental beta features. </p>

<p>Prefer to use a different program than what's included? Swap it out! SharkLinux makes software access a snap. App Grid offers an exceptional alternative to Ubuntu's native software centre, synatpic provides thousands of package options and to make life easier our repository is packed with applications normally only available by hunting down 3rd party sources.  </p>

<h2><a id="releases" class="anchor" href="#releases"  aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Releases</h2>
<p>SharkLinux does not version it s releases, but rather is a rolling release distro and is frequently updated with new features and improvements. The officially released install media (ISO) is updated after any major changes, updates to the apt repositories and for each kernel release. Users who install in the cloud, using a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 instance and bootstrap installer will end up with the most current version possible.</p>
<h1><a id="unique-features-and-policies" class="anchor"  href="#unique-features-and-policies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unique Features and Policies</h1>
<h2><a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software"aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h2>
<p>SharkLinux has multiple qualities that make it unique from Ubuntu and other derivatives. Unlike Ubuntu and many variants, SharkLinux does not have a strict policy regarding software being exclusively open-source. The distribution maintains its own exclusive software repo, thus some software not offered in any official Ubuntu Repo are either included by default in official releases or easily installed via command line. Examples include Google Chrome and MEGASync. </p>
<h2><a id="relaxed-application-of-sudo" class="anchor" href="#relaxed-application-of-sudo" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Relaxed Application of Sudo</h2>
<p>A fundamental and controversial difference is the removal of the sudo password. While sudo is still used to run commands with root power and distinguish admin from user accounts, a sudoer is only prompted for password during login. Some users enjoy the relaxed sudo policy while many consider this to be a significant security risk. As a result this change is reversible allowing a sysadmin to re-enable the default sudo behavior via the visudo command.</p>
<h2><a id="simplified-commands" class="anchor" href="#simplified-commands"aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simplified Commands</h2>
<p>A unique command set is also available while using the terminal. These often combine existing commands into a single action or simply shortening the command for convenience. Some shortened commands also incorporate the relaxed sudo policy. Most notably the apt-based commands usually can be executed by calling on the action and omit the need of added arguments. Install, uninstall (remove), purge and search can be executed as single word arguments. Combinations are also used within the package manager. For instance, typing “upgrade” into the terminal both updates the apt cache and performs any available package upgrades. While there are many commands exclusive to SharkLinux, none of Ubuntu equivalents are disabled and any commands used in Ubuntu would work in SharkLinux. To illustrate the changes, some examples are provided below in comparison to the Ubuntu equivalent.</p>
